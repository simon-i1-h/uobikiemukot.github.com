## preparation (for FreeBSD)
at first, you must enable following kernel options, see [High Resolution Console] for detail
[High Resolution Console]: http://www.freebsdwiki.net/index.php/High_Resolution_Console

~~~
options      VESA            # Build VESA module into kernel
options      SC_PIXEL_MODE   # Allows syscons to act on pixels rather than text
~~~

then add `allscreens_flags="MODE_xxx"` to rc.conf
this xxx value must be the same as MODE in conf.h

~~~
/* must be the same setting as current video mode */
MODE = xxx,
~~~

optional: set mtrr correctly (maybe following values are not correct in your environment)

~~~
# memcontrol set -b 0xe0000000 -l 0x10000000 -o SVGA write-combine
~~~

## install

~~~
$ cd freebsd
$ gmake
# gmake install
~~~

## usage

~~~
$ yaft
~~~

for displaying wallpaper, you can use yaft_wall script (it requires [fbv])
[fbv]: http://www.eclis.ch/fbv/

~~~
$ yaft_wall /path/to/wallpaper.jpg
~~~
