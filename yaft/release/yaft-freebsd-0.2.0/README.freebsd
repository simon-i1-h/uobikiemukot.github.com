## config (FreeBSD only)

+	MODE = 279, /* video mode see below */
+	KB_DELAY = 250, /* keyboard delay */
+	KB_REPEAT = 30, /* key repeat */

## preparation

at first, you must enable following kernel options, see [High Resolution Console] for detail
[High Resolution Console]: http://www.freebsdwiki.net/index.php/High_Resolution_Console

~~~
options      VESA            # Build VESA module into kernel
options      SC_PIXEL_MODE   # Allows syscons to act on pixels rather than text
~~~

then add `allscreens_flags="MODE_xxx"` to rc.conf
this xxx value must be the same as MODE in conf.h

~~~
/* must be the same setting as current video mode */
MODE = xxx,
~~~

optional: set mtrr correctly (maybe following values are not correct in your environment)

~~~
# memcontrol set -b 0xe0000000 -l 0x10000000 -o SVGA write-combine
~~~

## install

~~~
$ gmake
# gmake install
~~~
